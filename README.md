Repository: house

In a world of bricks and beams,
Where dreams and memories gleam,
Stands a house so strong and true,
Welcoming all, old and new.

With windows that whisper tales,
And doors that guard like knights in mail,
Each room a chapter, each wall a page,
In this sanctuary, worries assuage.

Roof over head, shelter from storm,
A place to keep us safe and warm,
In this humble abode we find peace,
Where love and laughter never cease.

So cherish this house, this humble place,
Where life's journey we embrace,
For within these walls, we find grace,
A home to cherish, a sacred space.
